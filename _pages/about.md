Currently I am a fourth year graduate student of School of Computer Science and Technology in Zhejiang University and a member of NCRC (Neuromorphic Computing and Robotic Cognition) Group.

I received my B.Eng. degree in College of Computer Science from Sichuan University in June 2020. In the same year, I was admitted to study for a PhD degree in Zhejiang University without entrance examination.

## Research Interests

My research interests include Neuromorphic Computing and Machine Learning.

Recently, I am interested in:

* Spiking Reinforcement Learning (SRL)
* Temporal Credit Assignment (TCA)
* Spiking Neurons
